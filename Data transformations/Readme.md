# Simple Data Transformations (Practice Project)

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic **data transformation techniques** using Python and Pandas.
It is designed as a **practice project for beginners**, using **mock data** for a fictional business scenario.
The aim is to clean and process customer and sales data to generate insights.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and inconsistent data types.
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Calculate customer age.
  - Derive customer lifetime duration (LTD).
  - Create full names from first and last names.
- **Sales Aggregation**: Calculate total and average sales per customer.
- **Data Integration**: Merge transformed customer and sales datasets.

## Dataset
The datasets used are:
- **`customer_data.csv`**: Mock customer data, including fields like `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`, and `created_at`.
- **`sales_data.csv`**: Mock sales data, with fields such as `customer_id`, `sales_channel`, `total_price`, and `order_date`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
